                            we saw several lights on the land, and four boats along the shore, of which two came towards us, 
                            and the other two—our own—returned on board... after they had returned on board the people in the 
                            two prows began to call to us, and that with a coarse, rough voice, but we could not understand in 
                            the least what they said. However, we called to them again in answer, whereupon they cried again 
                            several times, but came no nearer than a stoneshot. They also repeatedly blew on an instrument which
                             was like a Moorish trumpet. We let one of our sailors... play some pieces in answer. Those on the 
                             Zeehaen made their second mate do the same. After this had been repeated on both sides several times, 
                             and as the evening shade was falling more and more, those in the boats finally cleared and went away. 
                             We ordered our people (for security, and to be well on guard) to keep entire quarterly watch (as is 
                             usual at sea), and that the munitions of war, such as muskets, pikes, and cutlasses, should be got ready. 
                             We let off some pieces on the top deck and reloaded, so that all accidents might be forestalled and we 
                             might defend ourselves in case these people might attempt <span title="³ Art.
