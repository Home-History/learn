            Home History is a resource created with the intention of providing an accessible guide to teaching (and learning) history as a subject in a home schooling environment. 
            Although history is sometimes neglected as a school subject in favour of fundamental subjects such as English and mathematics, this author believes the study of history 
            contains crucial learnings within its disciplines. This involves not only gaining an understanding of past events and how they shape the world we live in, but also the 
            development of analytic and critical thinking skills; skills that will help the student parse information in a world awash with competing narratives.
            <br/><br/>
            This resource is not a prescriptive telling of history, nor does it attempt to be. It does not follow a standard chronological timeline of events. Instead, it introduces 
            key historical concepts and events as a means of study and investigation. Students are asked what we know about history, and how we know what we know. Although the approach 
            to history presented is somewhat academic in its scope, the content is formatted to be accessible to the student regardless of any background learning. 
            <br/><br/>
            The subject of the course revolves around New Zealand history, with much of the example content relating to Taranaki. This reflects the author's own current residence and 
            interest at the time of writing, although the concepts presented can be applied to almost any other topic of inquiry. The subjects chosen are generally non-controversial, 
            although as was discovered during research for this resource, controversy is sometimes found even where it is not expected. The subjects are relayed as neutrally as possible, 
            but inevitably the innate bias of the author will occur somewhere throughout the content (a subject in of itself which is covered).  
            <br/><br/>
            Although there is no absolute intended age for the resource, it is expected that it would be suitable for those aged 10+ years. The content is not overly word heavy, and has been 
            simplified where possible. The content has been broken up into lessons, often with related research tasks. It is recommended that time is taken to engage with the all the content
            displayed. It must be emphasized that this is designed to be a resource for use by educators and is not a standalone lesson in itself. With input from educators and students each
            lesson can probably be taken in 30min-1hr lesson periods, but this is entirely at the educator or learner's discretion.
            <br/><br/>
            The resource is perpetually a work in progress and any feedback is appreciated. The author can be reached via the <a href=donate.htmlt>Contact</a> page. Although the resource is 
            available for free, any and all donations to contribute to its upkeep and further development are greatly appreciated.
