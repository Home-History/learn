                <p>As was mentioned in the video on the previous page, the adoption of a flag in New Zealand was borne from the necessity for merchant ships to comply 
                with British maritime law. Adopted in 1834, what would become known as the flag of the United Tribes of New Zealand was chosen by northern rangatira, a flag
                originally designed by Henry Williams to represent the New Zealand Church Missionary Society. The flag prominently features the St. George cross, the national 
                flag of England.</p><br>

                    <p>Today, the flag of the United Tribes is sometimes flown as an alternative to the present day Blue Ensign, particuarly by those <abbr title="dissatisfied, especially with people in authority or a system of control.">dissaffected</abbr> 
                        with post-Treaty of Waitangi national political structures. It is the flag used to reperesent the <span title="Māori Government of Aotearoa Nu Tireni"><a href="https://govt.maori.nz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wakaminenga Māori Government</a></span>,
