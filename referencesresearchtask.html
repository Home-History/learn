                        <p>For this task, letâ€™s study a Wikipedia page. Choose a page that is relevant to a NZ historical subject to study (eg. a person, place or event of historical 
                            significance), ideally one with at least a few references listed. If you like, you may use the same page for <span title="Wikipedia/ Dicky Barrett (trader)"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220204095559/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dicky_Barrett_%28trader%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dicky Barrett</a></span> 
                             that was hyperlinked previously. <br><br>Have a look at where the citations are made in the article and the references that are used. Consider the following:</p><br>
                        <li>What sort of statements are the references used to back up?</li><br>
                        <li>Are the references primary or secondary sources? Where are the sources from? Are there links to online versions of the sources used?</li><br>
                        <li>Are there any statements made in the article that you think should have a citation (reference to source) that don't have one?</li><br><br>

                        make changes yourself to the page, as Wikipedia was originally designed to be an accessible <abbr title="UnHerd/ Wikipedia co-founder: I no longer trust the website I created"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210714140614/https://unherd.com/thepost/wikipedia-co-founder-i-no-longer-trust-the-website-i-created/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open source project.</a></abbr> 
                        This ease of access to content creation and editing by anyone is what has made Wikipedia so <abbr title="Ubiquitous: present, appearing, or found everywhere">ubiquitous</abbr> as an online encyclopedia resource. However, this is one of the reasons that Wikipedia is generally not trusted 
                        as an academic resource, and more than many other online resources, references must be scrutinised when using it for information.</p>
