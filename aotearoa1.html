                            following year as <i>Polynesian Mythology and Ancient Traditional History of the New Zealand Race</i> by Sir George Grey.<br/><br/>

                            Comprised as a collection of Māori myths and legends “<i>as Furnished by Their Chiefs and Priests</i>”, Grey consulted with various rangitira to produce the first collection 
                            of stories in the Māori language to be printed. Notable among these was Te Rangikāheke (Ngāti Rangiwewehi) , whose contributions are thought to make up at least a 
                            quarter of the whole work.<sup>1</sup> Recounting the legend of Māui, the English version reads as follows:</p>

                            <blockquote>Some of his descendants yet live in Hawaiki, some in Aotearoa (or in these islands); the greater part of his descendants remained in Hawaiki, but a few of them came here to Aotearoa.</blockquote>

                            <p>Another instance of reference to Aotearoa describes the “Construction of Canoes to Emigrate to New Zealand”</p>
                            
                            <blockquote>The workmen... are those who built the canoes in which our forefathers crossed the ocean to this island, to Aotearoa. The names of the canoes were as follows: the Arawa was first completed, then Tainui,
                                 then Matatua, and Takitumu, and Kura-hau-po, and Toko-maru, and Matawhaorua. These are the names of the canoes in which our forefathers departed from Hawaiki, and crossed to this land.<sup>2</sup></blockquote>

                                    The meaning of “Aotearoa” is popularly understood to translate approximately to ‘long white cloud’, an indicator of yet unseen land to ancient maritime explorers and settlers. In early written accounts “Aotearoa” 
                                    is referred to interchangeably with “Aotea”, invariably in reference to territory limited to within the North Island (Te Ika a Maui). Descriptions of separate tribal regions throughout the motu feature more prominently 
                                    among these traditions. Despite this, Aotearoa has become the name collectively given to refer to all island territories of the state of New Zealand (including the South/Te Waipounamu, Stewart/Rakiura and the Chatham/Rēkohu islands).</p>
