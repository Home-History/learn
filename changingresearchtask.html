                   <p>In this unit, you might have noticed that there were a lot of old newspaper articles and books used as sources. When attempting to research a chosen subject, sources like newspaper articles are often readily available as primary sources on a historical event. Luckily, much of this overwhelming 
                    large amount of information built up has now been digitised and is easily accessible with a simple search.</p>
                    
                    <center><abbr title="Commuters on a train in yesteryears reading newspapers"> <img src=
                        "images\resources\reading-newspapers4.jpg" height="auto" width="auto";

                    <p><a href="https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/" target="_blank">Papers Past</a> is the National Library of New Zealand's digital collection. Here you can access newpapers, magazines and journals, 
                    letters and diaries, parliamentary papers and books. Other countries have similar digitised collections, like for example <a href="https://trove.nla.gov.au/" target="_blank">Trove</a> of Australia.</p> 

                    <p>Another valuable resource for historians and researchers is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/" target="_blank">Wayback Machine</a> (Internet Archive). Here, webpages can be saved before they are changed or deleted to be 
                    accessed later. This is an invaluable tool to historians in the digital age. Much other media can also be accessed for free through the Wayback Machine, like books, videos and audio.</p></br>

                    <p>The task for this unit is to simply explore and familiarise yourself with <a href="https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/" target="_blank">Papers Past</a> (and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/" target="_blank">Wayback Machine</a>). Try out the search functions
                    with keywords and terms for any subject that interests you (if you are unsure what to search for you can search for information relating to Parihaka, as I did). Make use of the search filters available, like date range, for example.</p></br>

                    <p>As you search the archives, consider the following questions:</p></br>

                    <li>How many unique results are there for the search term?</li></br>
                    <li>Who are the writers, or source, of each article?</li></br>
                    <li>How are the old newspaper articles similar, or dissimilar, to modern day news stories?</li></br>

                    <p>Copy the address of a webpage (any webpage) and enter it into the search bar on the Wayback Machine.</p></br>

                    <li>Has the page been saved (or archived) already? How many times?</li></br>
                    <li>If you look at older archived versions of the page can you spot any differences or changes that have been made?</li></br>
                    <li>If it hasn't already been archived, would you like to? In most cases this can be done clicking the "web" menu at the top of the page and entering the address into the "Save Page Now" form.</li></br></br>

                    <p>In the next unit we wil be exploring deeper into sources and how they are interpreted, both in a historical context, as well as in modern times.</p>
