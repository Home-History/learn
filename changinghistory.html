                        <h1>Historiography</h1>
                        <hr/><br>

<p>Earlier in the course we broadly defined history as something like a study of past events. So how does the past change? While the events that happened and the people 
    that lived in the past don't change, how they are talked or written about often does. <abbr title="Historiography: the study of the history of history">Historiography</abbr> refers to the entire body of work 
about a given historical subject. When studying the historiography of a historical subject, you may find that interpretations of what happened in the past change throughout time. This is all the 
more likely for topics considered controversial. This is sometimes referred to as <abbr title="Historical revisionism: the reinterpretation of a historical account">historical revisionism</abbr>.</p></br>

<p>There are many reasons that history may be revised over time. These include:</p></br></br>

<li><b>Access to new evidence:</b> If any previously unknown sources or evidence are discovered it may change how past events are interpreted. </li></br></br>

<li><b>New scientific developments:</b> Like new evidence, access to new scientific developments may contribute to reinterpretation of historical events 
    (eg. <abbr title="Radiocarbon dating: the determination of the age or date of organic matter from the relative proportions of remaining carbon">carbon dating</abbr> of historical sites).</li></br></br>

<li><b>Political or cultural change:</b> When there is a shift in the political or cultural social climate, previously ignored or suppressed evidence may come to light, or 
certain historical interpretations may be emphasized over others. </li></br></br>

<p>In the previous module we can see some ways in which the narrative around the colonisation of Aotearoa has changed over the generations.
    Now, with an idea of how historical interpretions can change throughout time, we will look at a case study event as another example.</p></br></br></br>
