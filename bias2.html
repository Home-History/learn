                    <p>Being able to identify bias within sources is a critical skill when studying history. To the left is a particuarly brazenly biased newspaper 
                        article from 1881 concerning Parihaka. On the next page we will take a closer look at it. But for now, let's first cover some of the ways we can recognise 
                        biases in media.
                    </p><br><br>

                    <p>There are various ways to recognise bias in media. It is not always obvious, but when reading with a critical eye, telltale signs of bias can become apparent.
                        Some indications that a source may be biased are:
                    </p>

                        <li>Language is used that is either disparaging, or alternatively, praising of an individual or group of people.</li><br>
                        <li>Overly dramatic language is used to describe people or a situation, with the intention of eliciting an emotional response from the reader.</li><br><br>
                        
                        <p>Sometimes, it isn't just what has been said, but what hasn't been said that can indicate the presence of bias. In this case, it is the absence of information that 
                            would suggest that the author is creating a work that is biased. This would include instances where:</p>

                        <li>Comment is only sought from one side of an argument, or perspective.</li><br>
                        <li>Sources, for quotes or comment, are unattributed, or unnamed.</li><br>
                        <li><abbr title="Conjecture: an opinion or conclusion formed on the basis of incomplete information">Conjecture</abbr> is given where documentary evidence is lacking. </li><br><br>
                        
                         <p>A work that is intended to be unbiased should only present the facts of the matter, as they are known. This is typically what is expected, particuarly of news articles.
                        For this reason, we see a lot of "opinion" pieces being published within the news media. Media that makes judgements, seeks to attribute blame, 
                        or <abbr title="Cast aspersions: an attack on the reputation or integrity of someone or something.">cast aspersions</abbr> on others is usually engaging in 
                        <abbr title="Rhetoric: the art of effective or persuasive speaking or writing">rhetoric</abbr>, rather than simply informing the reader of the situation.</p><br>

                        <p>Where we may be able to identify potential bias in sources, there can still remain the question of why the bias is present in the first place. In some cases, as stated 
                            on the previous page, this may simply stem from the author of the source's unconscious conditioning, resulting in a work that reflects these deep-seated personal values. 
                            However, this is but one of a multitude of reasons for bias in sources. Other considerations as to <i>why</i> a source may be biased are:
                         </p>

                         <li><i>Cui bono?</i> Or in English, "to whom is it a benefit?". This may be along personal, political, or idealogical lines, or...</li><br>
                         <li>Follow the money: motivations for biased reporting may simply be due to where the funding for the work is coming from, and to what end.</li><br><br><br><br>

                         <p>This is by no means a complete list of the ways biases that can be identified in media, but with this baseline, let's have a go at identifiying 
                            markers for bias in some news articles on the next page.
