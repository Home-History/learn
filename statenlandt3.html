                        <p style="font-size: 23px; font-family: Garamond; text-align: left;"> "19th.—This morning early a boat of these people, having thirteen men, 
                            came about a cast away from our ship. They called out several times, which we could not understand, the speech 
                            having no resemblance to the vocabulary given to us by their Highnesses the Governor-General and Council of 
                            India. But this is not to be wondered at, as it was the language of the Salomon Island. These people were 
                            (so far as we could see) of ordinary height, but coarse of voice and strong, their colour between brown and 
                            yellow. They had black hair, fast bound right up on the crown of their heads, in manner and fashion of the 
                            Japanese on their heads, but with a long, thick tuft of hair in which was stuck a large, thick white feather. 
                            Their boats were two long narrow prows fastened together, over which were placed some boards or other seats, 
                            so that those above can see through the water under the canoes; their paddles were a full fathom long, and 
                            harp at the end. With these boats they could obtain great speed. Their clothing (so it appeared) was some of 
                            mats, others of cotton, whilst most were naked to the waist. We pointed out to them many times that they should 
                            come on board, showing white linen and some knives from those given us in our cargo. But instead of coming nearer 
                            they returned at last to shore. Meanwhile the officers of the Zeehaen came on board us (by order of the previous 
                            evening), and a council was held, when it was resolved to go as near shore as we could, as there was good anchorage, 
                            and these people (as it seemed) sought our friendship. Soon after taking this resolution we saw another seven boats 
                            come from the shore, whereof one (high in front, and pointed), manned with seventeen men, pulled behind the Zeehaen, 
                            and a second (wherein were thirteen stout men) came up not half a cast from our ship, who called to each other several 
                            times. We showed them (as before) white linen, &c., yet they remained still. The master of the Zeehaen sent his 
                            quartermaster with his boat and six sailors back to the ship, to direct the mate, in case these people should come 
                            alongside, not to allow too many on board, but to be prudent, and well on his guard. Just as the Zeehaen's boat put off, 
                            the natives in the nearest prow to us called out and signalled with their paddles to those who were behind the Zeehaen, 
                            but what their meaning was we could not <span title="⁴ Art. XV.—Abel Tasman and his Journal, Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New Zealand,

                    that one lying between the two ships began to pull furiously towards it, and when about half-way from us struck the Zeehaen's boat 
                    furiously with their stems, making it lurch greatly at the same time; whereupon the foremost man in this villainous prow thrust the 
                    quartermaster, Cornelis Joppen, several times fiercely in the neck with a long, blunt pike, so that he fell overboard. Whereupon the 
                    others of them attacked the boat's crew with short, thick pieces of wood (which we at first took to be blunt [Malay] parangs)... and 
                    with their paddles, and overcame the boat, in which fray three of the Zeehaen's people were killed and a fourth mortally wounded through
                     hard blows. The quartermaster and two sailors swam towards our ship, and we sent our shallop to them and picked them up alive. After
                      this outrageous and detestable affair the murderers let the boat drift. They had one of the dead dragged into their prow, and another 
                      drowned. We, and those on the Zeehaen, seeing this, shot briskly with muskets and cannon, but, however, probably did not hit any, as 
                      both returned to shore out of shot. We fired many shots from our fore-upper-deck and bow guns near and amongst their boats, but did 
                      not strike. Our master, Ide Tercxsen Holman, rowed with our shallop, well manned and armed, to bring back the Zeehaen's boat (which, 
                      luckily, these cursed men had let drift), and presently returned on board with it, finding in it one of the dead and one mortally
                      wounded. We weighed anchor and got under sail, as we judged we could not establish any friendship with this people, nor could get
                       water or refreshments. Our anchors weighed, and being under sail, we saw twenty-two prows alongshore, whereof eleven, swarming with 
                       men, came off to us. We kept quiet until some of the first were within shot, when with our pieces we fired one or two shots from the 
                       gunners' room, but without effect. The Zeehaen fired too, and hit, in the largest prow, one who stood with a white flag in his hand, 
                       so that he fell down. We also heard the grape-shot strike in and against the prow, but what further happened is unknown to us, as after 
                       getting this shot they returned speedily to land, two of them setting up sails fashioned like [Malay] tinganghs. They remained quiet 
                       alongshore without visiting us <span title="⁴ Art. XV.—Abel Tasman and his Journal, Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New Zealand,
