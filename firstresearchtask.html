                    <p>With it now in mind that it is people that will be our primary object of study, let us now start with the first Studies of Aotearoa/New Zealand subject of research; YOU!<br/><br/>
                        Finding out about your background and where you come from can help with understanding where you fit into the world. It can also provide context to how we interpret history 
                        from a personal perspective.<br/> <br/>
                        There are many ways to find out about your whakapapa or genealogy. These may include <font color= "#076d9c">talking</font> to family members or close friends in the community 
                        (particularly elders). Maybe within your family there are <font color= "#076d9c">documents</font> or <font color= "#076d9c">records</font> relating to past family members. 
                        There may be <font color= "#076d9c">photos</font> kept. See how much new information you can find and how far back you can trace your ancestry.<br/><br/>
                        TIP: Many libraries and museums in New Zealand host research centres. These can be interesting depositories for local history and heritage resources. Many of these resources 
                        can also be accessed online. Some ancestry <font color= "#076d9c">website databases</font> are also accessible through local libraries. See the <span title="Te Pua Wānanga o Taranaki/Taranaki Research Centre"><a href="https://pukeariki.com/research-and-heritage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Puke Ariki website</a></span> for a Taranaki based example.</p>
