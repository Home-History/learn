                        <p style="font-size: 23px;  text-align: left;"> That same day following the bloody altercation, Tasman and 
                            the crew of the <i>Heemskerck</i> and <i>Zeehaen</i> resolved to leave behind “this place of murderers” in search of a more convenient spot 
                            to obtain water and refreshments. This encounter had taught them “to hold the inhabitants of this land as enemies”, bestowing 
                            upon the place of the incident the name Murderers’ (<i>Moordenaar's</i>) Bay, today known (somewhat ironically) as Golden Bay. 
                            Continuing north, they charted a course up the west coast of the North Island as far as Cape Maria van Diemen and the Three 
                            Kings Islands, the two remaining geographic features in the country to still today retain the names Tasman had given them. 
                            Of the land itself, Tasman determined that it seemed to be “a very fine country, and we trust that it is part of the great 
                            coast of the unknown Zuytlandt (South Land). Believing it possible that what they had happened upon was connected to the same 
                            land that his countrymen Schouten and LeMaire had previously found while looking for a new route to the Moluccas, located off 
                            the coast of South America*, Tasman bestowed this upon the map of this land its first given name; <i>Staete Landt</i>. Later found to
                             be in error, it was renamed <i>Zeelandia Nova</i>, or New Zealand</p></p><br/><br/><br/>

                             <p style="font-size: 20px;  text-align: justify;"> * It was discovered in 1643 by the Dutch Admiral Hendrick Brouwer 1643 that Staten 
                                Land was in fact an island, and therefore could not possibly extend to the region of Tasman’s discovery. Today, this land is 
                                known as Isla de los Estados, or Staten Island, in Argentina.</p>
