                            text-align: left;">For many Māori, regional tribal identity is connected to the waka, or canoe, that their ancestors were said to have arrived in.
                             These traditions, spoken through the generations, tell of various motivations and stages of migration to Aotearoa. Some histories tell of amalgamation
                              between tangata whenua and later immigrants from Hawaiki, whereas others tell of ancestors making landfall on unoccupied land that they then lay claim to. </br></br> 

                              Although individual ancestral voyaging waka traditions number in their dozens across various iwi within Aotearoa, due to the introduction and influence of the 
                              written word to New Zealand throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, for a time a more concise and singular narrative took hold in popular historical understanding. </p></br>

                            text-align: left;">Around the turn of the 20th c. an <abbr title="Amalgamation: the action or process of uniting or merging two or more things">amalgamation</abbr> of waka voyage traditions was formed to create a single, heroic narrative of the settlement of Aotearoa 
                                      from Eastern Polynesia. This took the form of the “Great Fleet of Seven Canoes”, which was said to have taken place around the year 1350 CE. Although 
                                      largely the work of the ethnologist and author Stephenson Percy Smith, with the recorded traditions interpreted by <span title="Te Ara/ Jury, Hoani Te Whatahoro"><a href="https://teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/1j6/jury-hoani-te-whatahoro">H. T. Whatahoro</a></span>, 
                                      Smith took the numerous, and sometimes <abbr title="Disparate: different in kind; not able to be compared">disparate</abbr> Māori traditions, and edited them into one grand, cohesive narrative. This took hold in New Zealand folklore, with <i>Aotea</i>, <i>Kurahaupō</i>,
                                      <i>Matatua</i>, <i>Tainui</i>, <i>Tokomaru</i>, <i>Te Arawa</i> and <i>Tākitimu</i> as the chosen <abbr title="Progenitor: one from which others are descended or originate; an ancestor or parent">progenitor</abbr> canoes.* Needless to say, tribal traditions from across the country differed in 
                                       the number, names, or timing of the waka; nonetheless it was the above seven that made up “Great Fleet of Seven Canoes” legend that gave New Zealand its 
                                       ancient original founder’s story, which still holds some weight generations later.</p>
