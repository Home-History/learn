                <h1>Flags of the Nation</h1> 
                    <hr/><br>
                    
           <p>Throughout Aotearoa there are various flags that can be reguarly seen flying on any given day, representing either the nation itself or other abstract concepts. 
            Some of the ones that are commonly used to represent the country we will consider in this module. But for now let's start with the official internationally recognised 
            national flag, the New Zealand Ensign, by watching the video below, <i>The History of the New Zealand Flag</i>.

            <center><iframe width="864" height="486" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/g1-WhsDA-Iw" title="YouTube video player" 
                frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" 
                allowfullscreen></iframe><br/><br/></center>
           </p>

           <p>As shared in the video, the current day national flag was originally a variation on the Blue Ensign, a flag to be carried by merchant vessels as required by British 
            maritime law. Although having been established as a sovereign nation since at the latest date <span title="New Zealand Sovereignty: 1857, 1907, 1947, or 1987?, New Zealand Parliament Pāremata Aotearoa, 28 Aug 2007">1987,<sup>1</sup></span> New Zealand still carries the flag officially introduced in parliament 
            in 1900; the Blue Ensign with the Union Jack and four stars of the Southern Cross in the "fly". New Zealand's colonial legacy can be seen displayed prominently at official gatherings 
            where the flag is hung.</p><br/>
