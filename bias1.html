                <h1>What is Bias?</h1> 
                    <hr/><br>
                    
                   <p><Strong>Bias</Strong> is described by Oxford Languages as "inclination or prejudice for or against one person or group, especially in a way considered to be unfair."
                    When relaying history, it would be deemed to be <strong>biased</strong> if the author were to tell a one-sided account of what happened.</p>

                    <p>The reasons for bias in history are various. They include:</p></br>

                    <li><strong>Political bias:</strong> The promotion of one faction or ideology over others, or denigration of a rival to create a narrative favourable to the author.</li></br>


                    
                    <li><strong>Personal bias:</strong> The author may have a personal grudge against a particular group or individual and use their platform to create a narrative
                        which is unfavourable to the subject.</li></br>

                    <li><strong>Corrupted bias:</strong> The author may have been paid (or bribed) to create a narrative favourable to the paying party.</li></br></br>
                    
                    <p>The above reasons are examples of bias which would almost certainly be undertaken consciously. There are, however, other less obvious ways a historical work may be
                        biased:</p>
                    
                    <li><strong>Cultural bias:</strong> Relaying a narrative reflecting their own cultural values, ignoring other viewpoints or omotting evidence.</li></br>

                    <li><strong>Confirmation bias:</strong> A tendency to search information by looking for, or interpreting, information that is consistent with existing (usually learned) beliefs.</li></br>

                    <p>These are examples of biases that are more often unconsciously undertaken. As you can see, as a historian it is almost impossible to create a work that 
                        is free from bias. This resource itself is no exception, the content undoubtedly coloured by the author's (mostly unconscious) biased tendencies. As creators 
                    of media, we should try to be aware of our biases and strive to be as balanced (or unbiased) as possible, and as consumers of media we should <abbr title="Endeavour: try hard to do or achieve something">endeavour</abbr> to view works critically.</p>
                    
                    <p>Next, we will look at some ways to identify bias within sources.</p>
