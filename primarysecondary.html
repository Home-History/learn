                        <p style="font-size: 22px;  text-align: left;"> Sources that are contemporary to the period being studied are considered to be primary.
                             They are usually first hand or eye witness accounts. Common examples of historical primary sources are official documents, letters, 
                             diaries and newspapers. Speeches, video and photos from the studied period can also be primary sources. Art can also contribute to
                              historical understanding; commissioned portraits are commonly used primary sources. Even buildings and other significant physical 
                              structures can contribute to our understanding of architecture and cultural heritage.<br/><br/>

                <p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: left;  margin-right: auto; "> Secondary sources are works that draw on primary sources (or other secondary sources)
                     to describe, explain, or argue a historical point of view or account of past events.<br/><br/>

                    Like primary sources, secondary sources can come in a wide variety of media. Some common forms of secondary sources include books, journals or 
                    documentaries, among others. This Home History resource itself can be considered a secondary source.<br/><br/>
                    
                    When considering the veracity of a secondary source we sometimes are led to trust in the authorâ€™s authority on the subject. However, if the work
                    is <font color= "#076d9c">referenced</font>, we can easily check for ourselves the authenticity of the sources the author has used.</p></p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
