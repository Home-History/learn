                        he was given the following instructions in conduct with any “civilised men” encountered: </p><br/><br/>
                        
                        <blockquote>You will give to them greater attention than to wild barbarians, endeavouring to come into contact and parley with [the] magistrates and subjects, letting them know that you have landed 
                            there for the sake of commerce, showing them specimens of the commodities which you have taken on board for the purpose... especially trying to find out what commodities their country yields, 
                            likewise inquiring after gold and silver whether the latter are held [by them] in high esteem; making them believe that you are by no means eager for precious metals, so as to leave them ignorant
                             of value of the same; and if they should offer you gold or silver in exchange for your articles, you will pretend to hold the same in slight regard, showing them copper, pewter or lead and giving 
                             them an impression as if the minerals last mentioned were by us set greater value on.<br/>
                            You will prudently prevent all manner of insolence and all arbitrary action on the part of our men against the nations discovered, and take due care that no injury be done them in their houses, 
                            gardens, vessels, or their property, their wives, etc.; nor shall you carry off any of the inhabitants from their country against their <span title="¹ Salmond, A, (2014) First Contact: Tasman’s Arrival in Taitapu, 1642, BWB Texts, p.8">will...<sup>1</sup></span></blockquote>
