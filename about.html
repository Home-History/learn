                    Home History is an education resource designed for use in home schooling and education. It provides learners and educators with the tools required to 
                    research and understand historical events and concepts for themselves. The subject content deals specifically with New Zealand history, however the approach
                    to learning taught can be applied to various fields of research.

                        Andrew graduated from Victoria University of Wellington with a Bachelor of Arts in History, which was completed in conjunction with a minor in MƒÅori Studies
                        to gain a deeper insight into indigenous perspectives with regards to history. He has experience teaching history internationally at a secondary school level.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Noticing the growth of home schooling in recent years, Andrew was inspired to create a resource that would not only help introduce history as a subject to home schoolers and educators, 
                        but present the information in an easily accessible format. The Home History website has been built from raw code HTML, with the intention of cutting out any extra 
                        fees and middle-men required in its delivery.
