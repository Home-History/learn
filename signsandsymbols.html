            <p>In this module we will look at the significance imagery plays in constructing a national consciousness, and also how that it communicated to our unconscious understanding
                of our country and what it means to us.
            </p> 

            <p>As we saw previoiusly with propaganda, images can be used effectively to trigger an emotional response from the targeted audience, even with barely any words or 
                context. This is usually a learned response, often as a result of ingrained value systems, or for example, in the case of propaganda, through manipulative conditioning.
                People can, through simply seeing an image, be made to feel emotions such as pride or admiration, or negatively, anger and resentment.

            <p>It is said that "a picture is worth a thousand words", and there is certainly at least some truth to this, with the general idea that much can be conveyed through imagery, whether 
                it be emotive or informative.  A great deal of history can also be learned through the study of visual sources. Many of the images in this resource were indeed chosen for more than 
                simply visual appeal.</p>
                


            <p>In previous centuries, paintings of social scenes could help to inform us life in a bygone time, or a portrait of an influential ruler may show us how the subject wished to be regarded, 
                    or remembered, sometimes replete with cryptic symbolism for those with the "eyes to see". There is even an entire sub-discipline dedicated to the study of history through art, known as Art History.</p>

            <p>However, for now in our studies we will focus on visual form that is perhaps more mundane, but certainly no less important; our nation's flags.</p>
