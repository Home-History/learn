                   <blockquote>
                    
                        From a reliable source we learn that the natives of Parihaka are in a deplorable state, consequent upon the idle habits which they have been indulging for over two years. 
                        Since Parihaka became the centre of attraction to the surrounding tribes by the utterances of Te Whiti, the various settlements have been gradually decreasing until some 
                        have entirely disappeared. The result has been that Parihaka has become crowded by an idle and useless lot of people who make no provision for themselves in any way,
                         either by obtaining food or clothing. Te Whiti himself has been supported chiefly by contributions from natives outside Parihaka, who have sold their land and almost 
                         everything belonging to them to give presents to the prophet, for the purpose of providing food for the monthly feasts. The result has been that the natives have not
                          sown any crops this season, nor have they made any preparation for planting their old cultivations.
                        
                          The settlements present a neglected and forsaken appearance, and, indeed, that could scarcely be otherwise, seeing that the natives spend three weeks out of every month 
                        at Parihaka. The natives are now beginning to feel the effects of their idle, improvident habits, for they are scantily clad, and have no money. To add to their misery,
                         we are informed that they are fearfully affected with vermin at Parihaka, which has been induced by the crowded state of the whares and the want of cleanliness.
                          Parihaka is absolutely filthy for want of sanitary precautions, and it is anticipated that as summer advances some pestilential disease will make its appearance. 
                          It is consoling to know, however, that even if such a dire contingency did happen it would not be without its beneficial effects, as it would most likely drive the
                           natives from Parihaka back to their old settlements, and the peace of the district would be secured for a time at least. If the amount of energy displayed by the 
                           natives in erecting political fences was directed to the peaceful pursuits of cultivating the ground, it would be immeasurably better for them, and would prevent 
                           the poverty and distress which must surely overtake them if the present course is pursued.</blockquote>
