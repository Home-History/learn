                    <p>Welcome back historians. How much did you discover about your own family roots in your research? You should now have more of a sense of where you fit into this country’s timeline.<br/> <br/>
                        
                        Within your research you may have looked at the roots of your family name. Family names can often give clues as to one’s origins. They may denote characteristics of the <abbr title="Progenitor: one from which others are descended or originate; an ancestor or parent">progenitor</abbr>  such as which
                         kinship group they belong to, geographical locations they are from, religious affiliations, trade or occupations, caste, etc. As you can see, there are numerous factors that can contribute to 
                         the significance of a person’s name.</p>

                         <p>When thinking about what a name or title can tell us about someone or something’s history, we should consider the context in which it was given. When was the name given? Who gave it? Why was the particular name chosen?</p>
