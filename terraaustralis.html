                    <p>Following the European discovery of the Americas in the 15th century and subsequent exploitation of their riches, European explorers sought to replicate 
                        this success by attempting to locate the theoretical <i>Terra Australis Incognita</i>, or the Unknown Southern Land. It was thought that there would lie an undiscovered 
                        continent, rich in minerals and resources. At that point in time, little yet was known about the lands scattered throughout the vast Pacific Ocean, or the 
                        peoples that inhabited them. </p>

                            <p>Though <i>Terra Australis</i> appeared on maps prior to the 17th century, this was due to <abbr title="Conjecture: An opinion or conclusion formed on the basis of incomplete information"> conjecture</abbr> on the part of the mapmakers. However, the belief in the existence of 
                            a great southern continent was not just based on fanciful, but a hypothesis that there must exist a polar opposite to balance the Northern Arctic mass.  </p>
