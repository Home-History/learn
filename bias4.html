                    <hr/><br>
                    
                        <p><strong>Propaganda</strong> can be described as information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, used to influence or persuade an audience to further an agenda.
                            It relies primarily on a <abbr title="Manipulative: influencing the behavior or emotions of others to one's own advantage">manipulative</abbr> approach to promoting political or 
                            idealogical viewpoints, and building the social <abbr title="Consensus: a generally accepted opinion among a group of people">consensus</abbr> through groupthink. 
                        </p>

                        <center><abbr title="Left to right: Nazi WWII era anti-Jewish propaganda, American anti-German WWI propaganda, British Empire WWI enlistment propaganda"><img src="images\resources\imgonline-com-ua-collage-3EKsqSbpXFswz7AA-min.png" style="

                        <p>Above are commonly recognized propaganda images from previous world wars. Propaganda is a term that is easily relatable to a tactic states use during war time to demonise the enemy,
                            drive recruitment, or boost morale at home. However, less is understood generally about how propaganda is utilised in the media outside of periods of war, or there is 
                            a perception that propaganda is something that is only utilised elsewhere, in less understood foreign societies, by disreputable state leaders. In fact, propaganda is more <abbr title="Omnipresent: widely or constantly encountered; widespread">omnipresent</abbr> 
                            in our present day societies than many may realise.</p><br>

                                width: 900px; height: auto;" alt="propaganda examples"></abbr></center><br>
                
                            <p>Although the study and use of propaganda dates back centuries (or even millenia), in the 20th century propaganda was recognised for its potential to shape opinions are influence ideas 
                                in all facets of society. After its use by the German authorities to promote Nazi genocidal programmes, "propaganda" as a term became unsavoury to the public, yet its psychological techniques 
                                persisted, inspired by the prominent "father of public relations", American consultant to business and government Edward Bernays, author of books such as <i>Crystallizing Public 
                                Opinion</i> (1923), <i>A Public Relations Counsel</i> (1927) and <i>Propaganda</i> in 1928. As relevant to advertising as it is to politics, propaganda is just as commonplace today 
                                as at any other time in history, and its use even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_MtvpXb0H4" target="_blank"> admitted to by politicians in recent times.</a><br><br>

                    <h1>Research Task</h1> 
                        <hr/><br>

                        <p>The research task for this module on bias is really an ongoing task when doing research, or engaging in media of almost any description; that is, to approach the source crtically 
                            and be on the lookout for any signs that it may be biased, as we have done in the exercise on the previous page. Sometimes this is easy, and at other times unrecognisable.
                        </p>

                        <p>It may seem unreasonable to be searching all sources and media for potential bias all the time, and it is. Although ideally we would be able to pick up on any bias present, without 
                           personal expertise in every subject and unlimited time in the day this is often just not possible. Sometimes we will rely on others for information based on our confidence of their reputation or character
                        (for example, authors of secondary sources). In this, we should trust in our <abbr title="Intuition: the ability to understand something instinctively">intuition</abbr> as well as our critical senses, and if in doubt, dig deeper into what is being said and by who.</p>

                        <p>Looking back to the previous research task on <a href="migrationsresearchtask.html">Migrations & Settlement</a>, did you identify anything that could be considered biased within the sources looked at?</p><br>

                        <p>As you have probably gotten a sense for, the subject of bias is a dense topic, and something that is encountered constantly while studying history. Although we could be said to have only just 
                            scratched the surface on bias, we will for now move on and look at another element of study that is both within, and outside the study of history.
