                    <p>In the years that followed we can see various ways that the "invasion", "trouble", or "difficulty" at Parihaka, and its aftermath was
                        recounted by authors. For many decades the incident was largely sidelined and only spoken of in passing. However, in some books we can 
                        find various published recollections of what happened at Parihaka on the 5th of November and what it would come to mean for the the 
                        region and nation.</p>

                    <p>Writing in a local history of Hāwera in 1904, William Alphonsus Quin tells of the threat that Parihaka was perceived to be, where:</p>
                    
                    <blockquote>it was known that there were fully sixteen hundred able-bodied Maoris in the prophet’s pa at the time, there appeared to be every prospect of the vexed Maori question 
                        being finally decided in a pitched <span title="The story of Hawera, W. A. Q. (William Alphonsus Quin), C.O. Ekdahl, Caxton Printing Works, Hawera, N.Z., 1904, p. 60">battle.<sup>1</sup></span></blockquote>

                        <p>Luckily, to the authors mind, this crisis was evaded thanks to the bold action of the "gallant" Major Tuke, who:</p>

                        <blockquote>stepping over the forms of the muttering young men... quietly arrested the prophet, and sent him out with an escort. The bloodless conquest of Parihaka was thus 
                            satisfactorily accomplished, and the turbulent prophets sent to the South Island to cool their fevered <span title="ibid., pp. 60,61">imaginations.<sup>2</sup></span></blockquote><br>

                    <p>In the book <i>Fifty Years of Volunteering</i> published in 1910, the writer Lieut.-Colonel H. Slater, V.D. concurs with Quin in the praising of:</p>

                    <blockquote>the force that marched on Parihaka in November, 1881, and who, though no shot was fired, destroyed the mana of Te Whiti, and practically settled the Native scare for <span title="Fifty years of volunteering : the army of regulations, Slater, H. (Henry), Whitcombe and Tombs, Christchurch, N.Z., 1910, p. 47">ever.<sup>3</sup></span></blockquote>
                    
                    <p>Further to the "congratulation that the Parihaka campaign was a bloodless one", Slater included a quote from the Lyttelton Times stating that:</p>

                    <blockquote>“The Native difficulty has given us many bad legacies. But it has given us one good thing, it has given us evidence of the sterling character and patriotic spirit of the Volunteer <span title="ibid., p. 49">Force."<sup>4</sup></span></blockquote><br>

                    <p>William Pember Reeves, in his seminal historical book <i>The Long White Cloud</i> in 1898 was "one of a small minority of New Zealanders who thought that our (Pākehā) neglect to make the (land) reserves 
                        put us in the wrong in the affair". He summarised the affair thus:</p>

                    <blockquote> It is true that the delays in redeeming promises concerning reserves to be made and given back from the confiscated Maori territory were allowed to remain a grievance for more than another decade, and led, as late as 1880, 
                        to interference by the natives with road-making in some of this lost land of theirs in Taranaki. There, round a prophet named Te Whiti, flocked numbers of natives sore with a sense of injustice. Though Te Whiti was as pacific as eccentric,
                        the Government, swayed by the alarm and irritation thus aroused, took the extreme step of pouring into his village of Parihaka an overwhelming armed force. Then, after reading the Riot Act to a passive and orderly crowd of men, women, and 
                        children, they proceeded to make wholesale arrests, to evict the villagers, and to destroy houses and crops. Public opinion, which had conjured up the phantom of an imminent native rising, supported the proceeding. There was no such danger,

                    <p>However, Reeves concluded his account, opining that:</p>

                    <blockquote>the breaking up of Parihaka was at last followed up by a reasonable and liberal settlement of the long-delayed Reserves question, a settlement in which Sir William Fox and Sir F. Dillon Bell did humane and honourable service, it may be 
                        classed as the last of the long series of native alarms. There will be no more Maori <span title="ibid., p. 226">wars.<sup>6</sup></span></blockquote><br><br>

                        <p>In later decades, authors became demonstrably more sympathetic to the treatment of Māori during the 1800's. First published in 1959, Keith Sinclair, in his book <i>A History of New Zealand</i>, described the situation at Parihaka leading up to 1881 as follows:</p>

                        <blockquote>(Te Whiti's) followers lived a virtuous and industrious life, but they were settled on land which had been confiscated. The Maoris believed, no doubt rightly, that McLean 
                            (who died in 1878) had promised them reserves; but the Government began to survey the land before these were granted. Te Whiti launched a passive resistance campaign. Parties of 
                            Maoris pulled out survey pegs, built fences across the disputed land, and began ploughing up neighbouring European farms as a form of protest. These tactics infuriated the settlers 
                            to the point of <span title="A History of New Zealnd, Keith Sinclair, Pelican Books, 1984, pp. 147-148">hysteria.<sup>7</sup></span>
                        </blockquote></br>
                    
                        <p>A cultural shift was certainly in motion by the latter half of the 20th century. Pākehā author Dick Scott in 1975 published <i>Ask That Mountain: The Story of Parihaka</i>, to address what he 
                        termed a "hitherto overwhelmingly one-sided record, it was an impatient and angry attempt, but a <span title="Ask that Mountain, Dick Scott, Reed/Southern Cross, 1975, p. 7">beginning".<sup>8</sup></span> 
                        However, to some not angry enough, as a reviewer for the Victoria University's student magazine <i>Salient</i> wrote:</p>

                        <blockquote>...ASK ANY MOUNTAIN [<i>sic</i>] is a profoundly disturbing documentary of an episode of our history that requires much greater reappraisal than occurs at present, but is handicapped in several respects. There is not sufficient anger over what happened, and the wishy-washy 'answers' 
                            provided are no real solution.</blockquote>

                            <blockquote> So long as New Zealand society is infected by the rampant individualism of capitalist attitudes communal ideals such as those of Parihaka can find little place, and true respect for a communal culture is <span title="Salient.

                        <p><i>Ask That Mountain</i> was followed by Tony Simpson's <i>Te Riri Pakeha: The White Man's Anger</i> in 1979, in which he determined to show the intended (specifically Pākehā) readership, that "the treasured belief
