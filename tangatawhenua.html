                           <p>Existing alongside this tale of courageous Polynesian voyaging and the settlement of Aotearoa ran a subtext of colonisation 
                            and subjugation. S. Percy Smith and his contemporaries wrote of an earlier “aboriginal” people inhabiting New Zealand prior to settlement by those 
                            of the “Great Fleet” from Eastern Polynesia (although not coming before Kupe, who was said to be the original discoverer of Aotearoa several centuries 
                            prior). Referred to as <i>Mouriuri</i>, they were described as an “inferior, dark skinned people”, in contrast to the daring, purposeful Polynesians.
                             The influential <abbr title="Ethnographer: a person who studies and describes the culture of a particular society or group">ethnographer</abbr> Elsdon Best described them thus:</p>

                            text-align: justify;">The original settlers of New Zealand, the Mouriuri folk, are said in Maori tradition to have been castaways, the descendants 
                            of the crews of three canoes named “Kahutara,” “Taikoria,” and “Okoki”. These vessels had been driven from their homeland by a westerly gale, 
                            and, after a drift voyage, made the coast of northern Taranaki, where the castaways settled. The wind that caused them to drift to those 
                            parts may have been a north-west one, but scarcely a west wind, unless a southerly drift took place later. These unwilling colonizers may 
                            have come from the New Hebrides, but not from Tasmania or Australia, the natives of which lands constructed no vessels that could live to 
                            cross the intervening ocean. They are said to have come from a hot-climate land, and found the climate here unpleasantly cold. Maori accounts 
                            describe them as having flat noses, distended nostrils, bushy hair, and restless eyes. They wore little clothing, and were improvident as to 
                            food-supplies. One might well suppose that the description was that of a Melanesian people, they being also described as dark-skinned—that is, 
                            in comparison with Polynesians. Personal and clan names, &c., preserved are assuredly Polynesian in form, though these may possibly have been given 
                            by Polynesian immigrants, or altered by them in order to conform with their own rules of phonology. Some writers believe them to have been a mixed 
                            Polynesian-Melanesian folk. The Maori states that they were a slim-built people, which Polynesians are not, and the account of them reminds one of...

                           <p>This narrative was taken up enthusiastically at the time and became the consensus among common people of understanding a pre-European colonisation in Aotearoa, 
                            school children and politicians alike. The willingness to indulge in these assumptions and speculations can be seen in the following passage from the author 
                            T. Lindsay Buick in 1900:</p>

                            <blockquote>Tradition, however vaguely, speaks of two races, both anterior to the Maori, the red-headed Turehu, whom the story relegates to fairy land, and the Moriori, 
                                of whose blood a strain is sometimes seen in a dark complexioned square-featured native, whose physique and countenance seem to indicate a union, by intermarriage, 
                                of the two races.</br></br> 
                            
                                These Morioris were evidently a milder-mannered and more generous people than the sea rovers from Hawaiki, and if we are to attach any value to the somewhat doubtful narrative 
                                of Sieur De Gonneville, a French navigator, who would seem to suggest that he spent some six months among them in 1503, and was received "with veneration and treated with friendship," 
                                we must believe that they were "a simple people, desiring to lead a life of happiness without much labour." Certainly the results harmonise with this description, for at
                                 no period do they appear to have displayed warlike proclivities, or produced a leader able enough to resist, even with temporary success, the aggression of the Maori, who, 
                                 within one hundred and twenty-years of their landing, had wrested from them the whole government of the islands, and reduced the survivors of the inter-tribal wars to a condition of 
                                 vassalage, if not of actual slavery.</br></br> 

                                 (They) were driven in desperation to choose between a long and dangerous voyage to the Chathams and extermination at the hands of the warlike adventurers from Polynesia. 
                                <b>Unfortunately there are few traditions, and no historical records, preserved by the living natives concerning these <span title="T. L. Buick, Old Marlborough, or, The Story of a Province, pp.45-46">people.</b><sup>3</sup></span>

                        <p>Modern interpretations of history (as well as their own traditions) locate the Moriori indigenous homeland at Rēkohui/Chatham Islands, not the main islands of New Zealand itself.
                            The narrative of the Moriori as the original inhabitants of Aotearoa suffering at the hand of later marauding Māori settlers appear to have been based more on speculative stories 
                            of later European colonists, rather than substantive evidence. However, writers like T. Lindsay Buick (quoted above) could have gotten their historical chronologies crossed with
                            later genocidal encounters between Moriori and Māori, as happened in 1835.</p>

                                          <p>It was in Novemeber of 1835 that around the people of the Ngāti Tama and Ngāti Mutunga iwi were in modern day Wellington, having
                                            been forced to flee their tribal homelands in Taranaki following aggressions by invading Waikato tribes. Here they had lived until further 
                                        threatening pressure came from the competing Ngāti Toa and Ngāti Raukawa iwi in Te Whanganui a Tara (Wellington). Joining together, they comandeered

                                slaughter of hundreds of the pacifist Moriori and the subsequent enslavement of the the remaining population, lasting until 1863, by which point it is said 
                                that merely 100 Moriori remained.  </p>

                            petitioned the Crown colonial government for the restoration of their indigenous lands. However a Native Land Court established in 1870 awarded 98% of the land 
                        to Ngāti Mutunga, by right of conquest.  </p>
