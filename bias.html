                   <p>In the previous unit we saw some of the ways stories of the past can be told in various ways, depending on who is telling them. We are now going to 
                    investigate how it is that multiple sources can be reporting on essentially the same event, yet end up with different conclusions.</p>
                     
                    <p>While previously we identified some ways that history may be interpreted differently over time (<a href=changinghistory.html>New evidence,</a> <a href=changinghistory.html>New scientific developments,</a>
                    <a href=changinghistory.html>Political or cultural change</a>), we are going to look at a concept that is <abbr title="present, appearing, or found everywhere">ubiquitous</abbr> throughout practically every historical, 
                    and even current events reporting, that is; <strong>bias</strong>. </p>
