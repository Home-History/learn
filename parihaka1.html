                        <blockquote>Founded in the mid-1860s, Parihaka was soon attracting dispossessed and disillusioned Māori from around the country. They were impressed by the kaupapa of its main leaders, 
                            Te Whiti-o-Rongomai and Tohu Kākahi, both of the Taranaki and Te Āti Awa iwi.</blockquote>

                            <blockquote>When in May 1879 the colonial government moved to occupy fertile land on the Waimate Plains that had been declared confiscated in the 1860s, 
                            Te Whiti and Tohu developed tactics of non-violent resistance.</blockquote>
                        
                            <blockquote>On 5 November, about 1600 volunteers and Constabulary Field Force troops marched on Parihaka. Several thousand Māori sat quietly on the marae as singing children greeted the force led by Native Minister John Bryce. 
                            The Whanganui farmer had fought in the campaign against Tītokowaru (see 9 June) and viewed Parihaka as a ‘headquarters of fanaticism and disaffection’. Bryce ordered the arrest of Parihaka’s leaders, the destruction 
                            of much of the village and the dispersal of most of its inhabitants. The Sim Commission which investigated these events in the 1920s was told that women were raped by troops, with some bearing children as a <span title="'Invasion of pacifist settlement at Parihaka ', URL: https://nzhistory.govt.nz/occupation-pacifist-settlement-at-parihaka, (Ministry for Culture and Heritage), updated 5-Nov-2021">result.<sup>1</sup></span>

<p>Behind such <abbr title="Scurrilous: making or spreading scandalous claims about someone with the intention of damaging their reputation">scurrilous</abbr> headlines ran stories that sought to disgust readers as to the state of the Parihaka settlement. A narrative was being formulated
                        of a people residing in degradation and <abbr title="Heretical: believing in or practising contrary to orthodox religious (especially Christian) doctrine.">heretical</abbr> fanaticism. The article to the left, "Dirty Parihaka", published in the West Coast Times, 
                        14 September 1881, 
                    is a particuarly blunt example of such reporting.</p>

              <p>Other newspaper reports reinforced the notion of those at Parihaka as squatters, residing illegally on land that they had no rights to. The journalists noted that
                it was "hoped the Constabulary will take some action in the <span title="OUTRAGE BY PARIHAKA NATIVES. ♦ [UNITED PBEBS ASSOCIATION.]

                <p>In the days leading up to the "action" taken by government troops, the press reported favourably on the "fine, smart set of young fellows" that made up the Taranaki Mounted Rifles, who were to join with the 
                    more than 1400 men and march on <span title="THE MARCH on PARIHAKA

                novel events about to unfold, despite the "stoppage of all public traffic... through the Parihaka block", where "the only persons who will be permitted to be present at the entrance to Parihaka, 
                in addition to the "force," are Ministers and their staffs, and... Press <span title="DISAPPOINTMENT IN NEW PLYMOUTH.

                <p>However, members of the press were to be disappointed, and the "action" they were hoping for instead became "A Wretched Fiasco", as journalists vented their frustation at being
                    barred from the events at Parihaka, as was reported by the Christchurch Star:</p>

	margin-right: 220px;">Dismay and consternation spread through the ranks of newspaper correspondents at Pungarehu on Friday when it became known late in the day that all civilians were forbidden to follow the advance 
                    of the forces on Parihaka, and would be arrested if found there on the entrance of the troops. Several journals had gone to great expense in sending men to the front ; and the wrath of these may 
                    be more easily imagined than put into polite language. The occasion was one of such extreme interest to people, whatever their opinions in the matter, that specials had been despatched by some 
                    papers for the express purpose of being on the spot during the one eventful day alone. Every effort was made to obtain a relaxation of the Draconian law, but in <span title="THE MARCH ON PARIHAKA.
